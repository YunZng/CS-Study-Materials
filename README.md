- Web Development(data visualization tools/library)

## [Data Structure](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clo/www/CMU/DataStructures/Lessons/)
1. Common structures: array, stack(LIFO), queue(FIFO)
2. Linked list: singly linked list, doubly linked list
3. Tree: binary tree, binary tree as an array, heap
4. [Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graphs-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/): degrees, and directed, undirected, connected, disconnected, complete, cyclic, and bipartite graphs
## Algorithm
1. Basic algorithms:
    1. [Searching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/): BFS, DFS
    2. [Sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/): Bubble sort, 
2. What is [space/time complexity](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/time-and-space-complexity#:~:text=Time%20complexity%20is%20a%20functionof%20input%20to%20the%20method.)? Understand the O notation
3. Shortest path:
    1. Dijkstra (forest fire algorithm)
6. Greedy:
    - Minimum spanning tree: Kruskal's greedy algorithm, pick smallest edges that do not result in cycles. Can use this algorithm to build roads between cities.
